##NOTICE:##
***flixel4unity is very old, and not recommend to use in any actual project.***<br>
*This is not going to update cause I've completely switch to HTML5.*
*But the project itself is usable if you're using Unity3 and familiar to Flixel older version.*

##Plan to continue developing Flixel4Unity##
* Make it compatible to Unity 3.x. (4.x in the future)
* Update design and implementation to flixel 2.55 or later version.
* Add some forum extends like HaxeFlixel does.
* Redesign structure to optimize more for Unity if possible.

##TODO:##
* Fix FlxArray clean method.
* Refactor sources.
* Write a getting start guide.
* Reimplement everything based on flixel 2.55.
* Add HaxeFlixel features.
